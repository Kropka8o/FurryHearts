# Conventions
- The code is in English, so variable, method, etc. names are all in English.
- Only add comments to explain _why_ code is as it is, _don't_ use them to explain what it does.
- For local variables and method parameters use ```camelCase```, e.g. myVariable.
- For method names, class names, properties, events, and public fields use ```PascalCase```, e.g. MyMethod.
- Use descriptive names, e.g. _not_ str, _but_ playerName.
- Indentation is 4 spaces, _not tabs_.
- Braces are on a new line.
- Use a space after keywords.
- No trailing comma's.
